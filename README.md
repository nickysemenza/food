## features

This is comprised mulitple components:

1. **parser** for extracting structured information from freetext ingredient line items.
   - e.g. `1 1/2 cups flour (180g), sifted` will be parsed into `ingredient: flour`, `cup:1.5`, `grams:180`, `modifier:sifted`.
   - This allows for recipes to be scaled up and down, and for ingredients to be tied together.
2. **scraper** for saving recipes from websites (nytimes, seriouseats) for later analysis.
   - This currently works on websites using `json+ld` with [the appropriate schema](https://schema.org/Recipe)
3. **usda** is used for mapping ingredients to their USDA database equivalent, which has very detailed nutrition information
   - e.g. [plain strawberries](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/747448/nutrients) or [C&H brown sugar](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/392083/nutrients)
4. **ui** for viewing/editing/creating recipes.
5. **cli** for interacting with the server instead of the API
6. **server** for exposing rest api
7. **notion** for extracting images from my Notion food log.

### todo

- allow merging ingredients together
- calculate average weights per-ingredient
- meals w/ multiple recipes at set quantities
- slugs for recipe urls
- associate ingredients with fdc ids on UI
- ingredient amounts should be generic (1-n val-unit pairs)
- substitute ingredients
- `$/unit` for ingredients?
- for imported recipes, keep 'original' ingredient line items pre-parsing
- ingredient dependency graph
